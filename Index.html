    <p>Jazz originated in <u>America</u> during the 1920's. <em>Jazz</em> is a genre of music that focuses on inprovization and communication between the musicians. Jazz gained popularity globally over the years. The unique thing about jazz is that old traditional tunes and songs can be reharmonized into the style of jazz.  </p>
    <p style="color:blue; font-size: 20; text-align: center; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Charlie Parker was a jazz artist during the 1950's. He revolutionized the style of jazz as he brought bebop, a complex way of improvising, to mainstream attention. Due to his work, he is considered the godfather of modern jazz, as he caused the push away from the New Orleans style of jazz.</p>
